## What I've learnt:
- Understanding return statements is key
  - especially that they terminate a loop
- Array index whoopsies:
  - i = 0 to i = (length - 1)
- String vs Number whoopsies
- Lack of console.log in testing:
  - use console.log liberally to debug
- Major error in input while loop:
  - **When collecting input until a sentinel, collect first input outside the while loop.**
- Divide and conquer remains goated
- And most importantly, understanding the problem. 

tracex: 
pos = 1
pos 1, 1 pos = 2
pos 2, 2, pos = 3
pos 3, 3, pos = 4
pos 4, 4 pos = 5
pos 5, 4, pos = 6
pos 6, 2, pos = 7
